# Rosetta
## Simple apps in many languages

Rosetta is a result of a process I used while learning different computer languages. Part of the difficulty in learning a new language is adapting to new syntax and methodologies, but a bigger part of the learning curve is picking up on that language's way of doing things. These can be discussed academically (in fact, that's often how this is taught) but I have found that these concepts don't really "take" until you start building concrete applications. So I came up with a few simple applications to help with learning different domains within a language, and just reimplemented them each time a learned a new language.

This repository isn't a complete listing of all of the languages I know. It also isn't all of the rosettas that I have written. I have been learning languages for years as a hobby and occasionally as required for a project. I'm sure that there are little rosettas littered across several of the computers I used over the years. Still, I felt that putting the ones I could find into one repo could be useful for reference. I will probably add to it over time, but I make no promises.
